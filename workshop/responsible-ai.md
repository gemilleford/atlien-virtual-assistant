### **Responsible AI in ATLien Assistant**

In AI-powered applications, ensuring that the system behaves responsibly is key to building user trust, protecting brand integrity, and maintaining legal and ethical standards. The most important aspect you will learn from this workshop is how to integrate **Responsible AI** into your app by focusing on **Content Moderation**, **Bias and Fairness**, **Transparency**, and **Prompt Engineering**.

These practices ensure your AI assistant provides helpful, appropriate, and fair responses to users while minimizing the risks of harmful or biased outputs.

### **1. Content Moderation in AI**

**Content moderation** is critical for preventing inappropriate or harmful responses from your AI assistant. By moderating both user input and AI responses, you ensure a respectful and safe interaction environment.

#### **Why Content Moderation Matters**:
- **User Trust**: Safe and appropriate responses maintain user confidence in the assistant.
- **Brand Integrity**: Your assistant must align with your brand’s tone and values, and offensive content can hurt your reputation.
- **Legal and Ethical Responsibility**: Failure to moderate responses could lead to legal or ethical issues if harmful content is generated.

#### **Approach**: Use **better_profanity** to moderate user input for inappropriate language. This ensures that the user’s input is clean before being processed by the AI.

Here’s how you can implement content moderation in **ATLien Assistant**:

```python
from better_profanity import profanity

# Initialize the profanity filter
profanity.load_censor_words()

def moderate_user_input(user_input):
    """Moderate input for profanity using better-profanity."""
    if profanity.contains_profanity(user_input):
        # Censor the profanity in the text
        return profanity.censor(user_input), True  # Censored text and flag as profane
    return user_input, False  # Return clean input
```

In your app, call this function when handling user input to check for offensive language. For example, integrate this into the `handle_user_input` function:

```python
def handle_user_input(flow, knowledge_base):
    if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
        # Moderate input for profanity
        cleaned_prompt, is_profane = moderate_user_input(prompt)

        # Display the cleaned prompt
        st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": cleaned_prompt})
        st.session_state.chat_history.append({"role": "user", "content": cleaned_prompt})

        if is_profane:
            st.warning("Your input contained inappropriate language and has been censored.")
```

### **2. Bias and Fairness in AI**

Ensuring **Bias and Fairness** is another critical component of Responsible AI. AI systems can unintentionally favor certain groups or give biased responses based on the data they were trained on. By implementing neutral prompts and pre-defined responses for sensitive topics, you can minimize bias and ensure fairness.

#### **Why Bias and Fairness Matter**:
- **Fairness**: The assistant must treat all user queries impartially and fairly.
- **Avoiding Stereotypes**: Sensitive topics like race, demographics, or neighborhood recommendations must be handled carefully to avoid perpetuating stereotypes.

#### **Approach**: Use **neutral prompt engineering** to reframe subjective user queries and implement **predefined responses** for sensitive topics.

Here’s how you can neutralize biased prompts:

```python
def neutralize_prompt(user_query):
    """Neutralize potentially biased queries."""
    if "best neighborhood" in user_query.lower():
        return "Can you provide a list of neighborhoods in Atlanta and what they are known for?"
    return user_query
```

Integrate this into your `handle_user_input` function after moderating for profanity:

```python
cleaned_prompt = neutralize_prompt(cleaned_prompt)
```

For sensitive topics, create a dictionary of pre-defined responses:

```python
sensitive_topics = {
    "diversity": "Atlanta is home to many diverse communities. You can explore various neighborhoods and their cultural highlights.",
    "safety": "Safety levels can vary across neighborhoods. It's best to consult official crime reports or community forums for detailed information."
}

def check_for_sensitive_topic(user_query):
    """Check if the query involves sensitive topics."""
    for topic in sensitive_topics:
        if topic in user_query.lower():
            return sensitive_topics[topic]
    return None
```

In your app, use this function to handle sensitive topics:

```python
response = check_for_sensitive_topic(cleaned_prompt)
if response:
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
    st.session_state.chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        st.markdown(response)
```

---

### **3. Transparency and User Communication**

Transparency builds trust by explaining the AI assistant’s capabilities and limitations to users. Users need to understand how the AI generates responses and that it may not always have up-to-date information.

#### **Why Transparency Matters**:
- **Builds Trust**: Users are more likely to trust the assistant if they know its limitations.
- **Manages Expectations**: Clear communication helps prevent frustration when the AI doesn’t know the answer to time-sensitive or complex questions.

#### **Approach**: Provide a disclaimer about the AI’s knowledge cutoff and offer ways for users to understand how the AI generates responses.

Display a **knowledge cutoff disclaimer**:

```python
def show_disclaimer():
    """Display a disclaimer about the AI's knowledge limitations."""
    return "Note: The assistant's knowledge is based on data available up until a certain date and may not reflect recent changes."
```

You can display this disclaimer when the AI assistant introduces itself or before providing an AI-generated response:

```python
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": show_disclaimer()})
st.session_state.chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": show_disclaimer()})
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    st.markdown(show_disclaimer())
```

For queries involving recent information, add a check for the AI’s knowledge cutoff:

```python
knowledge_cutoff = "September 2021"

def check_for_recency(user_query):
    """Check if the query requires recent information."""
    if "recent" in user_query.lower() or "latest" in user_query.lower():
        return f"My knowledge is current as of {knowledge_cutoff}, so I may not be aware of newer developments."
    return None
```

### **4. Prompt Engineering and Natural Language Processing**

A deeper understanding of **Prompt Engineering** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is vital to crafting meaningful, accurate, and useful AI responses. By leveraging prompt engineering, you can control the output of AI models, especially when trying to mitigate bias, create brand-specific responses, or provide consistent answers.

#### **Why Prompt Engineering Matters**:
- **Control Over Responses**: Well-crafted prompts guide the AI to deliver more accurate and relevant responses.
- **Consistency**: Structured prompts ensure that the AI assistant’s tone, style, and quality of responses remain consistent.
- **Mitigating Risks**: Proper prompt engineering can prevent harmful or biased outputs by guiding the AI toward fair, neutral answers.

#### **Approach**: Teach participants how to design and iterate on prompts to extract the most useful and relevant information from the AI model.

Example of a prompt to handle general user queries:

```python
def generate_prompt(user_query, knowledge_base_context):
    """Create a structured prompt to guide AI responses."""
    prompt = f"You are ATLien Assistant, an AI designed to help people navigate Atlanta. Here's some knowledge base information: {knowledge_base_context}. Now, answer the following user question: {user_query}"
    return prompt
```
